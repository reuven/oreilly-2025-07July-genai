    "# Intro to ChatGPT\n",
    "\n",
    "ChatGPT was released nearly 3 years ago. ChatGPT is a very sophisticated large-language model (LLM). The idea is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ChatGPT was \"trained\" on a enormous amount of text on the Internet\n",
    "- If you ask a question, it'll then respond using autocomplete, but at another level\n",
    "\n",
    "If you ask about Python, it'll then find the most likely word to start an answer, and then most likely word to come after, and then the most likely word to come after that, etc.  Because of the incredible amount of text that ChatGPT has been trained on, it can answer questions on just about any topic we can think of. \n",
    "\n",
    "Not only can ChatGPT give us text, but it can also give us code! \n",
    "\n",
    "Mistake #1 is: Have it write code for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you really want an LLM to write code for you, then you should have the expertise needed to review that code and make sure it's reasonable! If you can understand and defend that code in public (say, at a code review), then that's great!\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, let the LLM write code **with** you, but not for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "People are talking about \"vibe coding,\" which means that they describe what they want to the LLM, and they get code! \n",
    "\n"

    "# If not coding, then what?\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are a great benefit to coders! But not for writing code, at least not by themselves. One of the best ways to use LLMs in your coding work is as a sounding board, as a colleague who can give you some feedback on what you're doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "One great way to use an LLM is as a sounding board **BEFORE** you even start to write any code! Run your plan by the LLM, and see what it thinks. Where are the holes in your plan? Where could/should you approach things differently? Don't have it write code; just have it respond to your plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chatbot will almost always flatter you massively.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to argue with it! You need to poke holes in what it's saying! You need to push back!\n",
    "\n",
    "Ask the chatbot -- is this true? Why is this the case? Would it be better to do X instead of Y? What are the trade-offs between X and Y?\n",
    "\n",
    "Asking questions helps in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It gives you a better sense of whether the chatbot is telling you the truth. \n",
    "2. It forces you to crystallize your thinking and your understanding.\n",

    "\n",
    "You'll get feedback right away on your code, and you have to know enough to push back and/or ignore the stuff that isn't true or relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because LLMs are trained on code from the wild, and because Python has a long history and is very popular, it might very well auto-complete with nonsense or bad code or bad style.\n",

    "# Pair programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Pair programming is not a new technique. The idea is that two people share one computer and work together. In my experience as an instructor, when people pair , they (a) learn faster, (b) learn better and deeper, (c) finish the exercise faster, and (d) have fewer bugs than the people who insist on doing it themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pairing has issues -- from attitudes to people's availability. Using a chatbot isn't a bad way to pair program.\n",
    "\n",
    "A big benefit is that you're expressing yourself, which means you're forced to think things through in order to communicate them. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Present your strategy to the LLM\n",
    "2. As you code, or as you're about to write, ask the LLM what it thinks about each line, or each section of code. You might want (need) to say in the prompt, \"Don't rewrite the code, just give me an evaluation.\"\n",
    "3. Don't forget that it's OK (even good!) to push back and argue!\n",
    "\n",
    "With enough back-and-forth, you'll be more confident about your code, and your code will be better, because it will have gone through a process of discussion and argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also pair after the coding phase, give the LLM your code and have it do a code review."

Originally, OpenAI wanted to ensure that AI would be both available to everyone and safe for everyone. Some of the original people from OpenAI left, saying that the focus on safety had become secondary (or worse).\n",
